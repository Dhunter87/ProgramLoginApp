Login process for other apps

This has been incorporated into most of my apps,
if you see this version compared to the version on the CasinoGames app for example you will notice i am in ythe process of re-factoring the username and passwrod retrieval methods. still to be tested and completed.


for access as an admin user:
Username - Admin123
Password - Admin321

for access through normal user 
- first you have to go through the admin user options to regester a new user
- the add newly created login details.

to skip above process i have made exampleProfile.cs which allows you to pass through the process with:
Username - JD1990
Password - 123
